# Phase 10-03 Summary — Upstream fsi-dsp PR opened

**Plan:** 10-03 (bookkeeping — human-action checkpoint)
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-05-23

## Outcome

Upstream PR opened against `goodlabs-studio/fsi-dsp`:
- **PR:** https://github.com/goodlabs-studio/fsi-dsp/pull/3
- **Title:** `feat(MANIFEST): register accelerator artifact-type with apply_sequence schema`
- **Branch:** `feat/manifest-accelerator-type` @ `b117f3f`
- **State:** OPEN (awaiting upstream review/merge)

## What happened

User selected "Open PR via gh now" at the autonomous checkpoint. Sequence:

1. Pushed `feat/manifest-accelerator-type` to `origin` (github-goodlabs SSH alias routes to GoodLabs identity)
2. Initial `gh pr create` failed with "must be a collaborator" — active `gh` account was `8BitTacoSupreme` (Jeremy's personal), which is not a collaborator on `goodlabs-studio/fsi-dsp`
3. Switched active `gh` account to `gl-jhogan` (GoodLabs identity)
4. PR created successfully as #3
5. Restored active `gh` account to `8BitTacoSupreme`

## Provenance

The fsi-dsp branch contains a single commit (`b117f3f`) that adds one MANIFEST.yaml entry. cflt-ai's submodule pointer already points to `b117f3f` (landed in 10-02's atomic commit `ad2304f`).

After upstream merge, cflt-ai's `raw/repos/fsi-dsp` will fast-forward to the merged-into-main SHA on the next `git submodule update --remote`. The 14-day drift CI guard from Phase 9 will track this.

## Follow-up

None — Phase 10 is complete. The PR will merge on upstream's cadence; no cflt-ai-side action required.
