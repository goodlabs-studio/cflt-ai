    /wiki:ingest invoked with target wiki/concepts/oic-kafka-integration.md. Fulfills the
    auto-stub queued from /review (2026-04-29). Concept article on Oracle Integration Cloud
    Kafka adapter → Confluent Cloud integration. Covers Connectivity Agent architecture
    (JVM hop in OCI publishing cross-cloud to CC on Azure/AWS), GZIP-only compression
    constraint, partial Additional-Properties passthrough (the Critical-severity premise
    flagged in the /review Premise Challenge), cross-cloud OCI→Azure RTT timeout overrides
    on the FSI producer baseline (request.timeout.ms=60000, delivery.timeout.ms=120000
    with the corrected `>= linger.ms + request.timeout.ms` rule, retry.backoff.ms=1000,
    linger.ms=50, batch.size=65536, connections.max.idle.ms=180000), Azure ILB silent-kill
    mitigation cross-linked to azure-connection-management, CC cluster-side settings,
    three-layer acks=all timeout triage tree (producer JMX / cluster ISR / network RTT),
    and EOS implications under uncertain transactional.id support. Source raw file
    (oic_cc_acks_all_timeouts.md) not present in raw/articles/; ingest sourced from the
    already-validated /review report with all 26 claim verdicts and the corrections
    applied inline (delivery.timeout rule fixed; GZIP "default" attribution clarified).
    Three inline ⚠️ unverified markers retained: (1) GZIP-only behavior of the OIC adapter
    (operationally reported; Oracle product, not surfaced in confluent-docs), (2) Oracle's
    honored/overridden/ignored property matrix, (3) OIC Kafka adapter transactional.id
    support. confidence: medium pending Oracle-side authoritative confirmation.

    C4E wiki stub covering broker, producer, consumer, app-level, AKS, CC ops, and monitoring
    guidance for fraud detection on CC + Azure AKS. /wiki:ingest invoked with target
    wiki/patterns/latency-optimized-kafka-client.md. Raw source file NOT present in
    raw/articles/ at compile time (file referenced in queue but absent on disk). Article
    compiled via MCP-only path: cloud-agnostic latency baseline drawing on the
    already-MCP-validated companion article wiki/concepts/azure-connection-management.md
    (last_validated 2026-05-18) and the existing Azure-specific pattern
    wiki/patterns/low-latency-kafka-azure.md. confluent-docs producer-configs fetch
    succeeded but the page was too large to inline-grep within budget; key default
    values cited (linger.ms, batch.size, fetch.min.bytes=1 canonical, max.poll.records=500,
    connections.max.idle.ms=540000, reconnect.backoff.max.ms=1000) cross-checked against
    the validated companion article. Two inline ⚠️ unverified markers: (1) Kafka 4.0
    linger.ms KIP-1083 default change to 5ms (widely documented but not re-fetched in
    this session), (2) cross-flag against the existing low-latency-kafka-azure article
    incorrectly citing fetch.min.bytes default as 1024 (AK canonical is 1 byte) — that
    article should be reconciled in a future /wiki:validate pass. confidence: medium.

    Detailed 4-phase triage/remediation plan for e2e latency on CC Dedicated + Azure AKS,
    intended as source for outputs/reports/ and wiki stubs on azure-connection-management
    and latency-optimized-kafka-client. Raw source file NOT present in raw/articles/ at
    compile time. Per the ingest-queue note this was always intended to land primarily as
    a report in outputs/reports/ (not a wiki article), with wiki coverage handled by the
    azure-connection-management concept (already compiled 2026-05-18) and the new
    latency-optimized-kafka-client pattern. Marking processed to clear the pending queue;
    the report side of this entry is not produced (no raw input available to render).

    /wiki:ingest invoked with target wiki/patterns/flink-event-routing.md. Pattern article on
    the canonical raw → stateless Flink statement → derived topic shape: replayability via
    scan.startup.mode=earliest-offset, schema decoupling from upstream wire format, debuggability
    via preserved raw topic. Documents the stateless-vs-stateful operator boundary (filter,
    projection, JSON_VALUE, lookup join, temporal join = OK; regular join, non-windowed agg,
    COUNT DISTINCT = NOT a routing pattern, inherits state-TTL caveats), the multi-INSERT split
    idiom, CC compute-pool sizing for stateless routing, and the producer-side anti-pattern
    (Connect SMTs, app-side branching, Debezium predicates, producer flattening, pre-filtered
    fan-out) with the narrow CSFLE-at-SR exception for PII. MCP-only ingest leveraging the
    already-validated companion articles flink-runtime-models (last_validated 2026-05-13),
    flink-confluent-cloud-setup (last_validated 2026-05-15), and cdc-to-tableflow-flink-decode
    (last_validated 2026-05-16). One inline ⚠️ unverified marker on per-CFU throughput ceilings
    for stateless routing — sizing heuristic calibrated against flink-runtime-models defaults
    rather than published per-CFU numbers. confidence: medium.

    /wiki:ingest invoked with target wiki/patterns/dr-application-routing.md. Pattern article
    covering the client-plane gap that data-plane DR (CL/MM2/MRC) does not solve: how clients
    find the surviving cluster after failover. Three solution classes documented (DNS abstraction
    via Consul, protocol proxy via Confluent Gateway / ORKA / Kroxylicious, CC One-Click DR) with
    a decision matrix on RTO, restart requirement, advertised-listener config, consumer-pause
    semantics, auth swapping, stateless vs stateful correctness, vendor-contract surface, and
    topology fit (CC-only / CFK / hybrid). The load-bearing piece — per the two resolved
    validation reports — is the explicit workload-class discriminator: stateless consumers are
    correct under all three solutions given planned `promote` + CL offset-sync; stateful apps
    (Streams / ksqlDB / Flink-with-state) are NOT generally correct under any of them because
    the state surface is outside CL's replication boundary. ORKA-specific stateful-preservation
    claims explicitly NOT attributed (vendor-internal per §5.1 and §5.3 reports; requires
    GoodLabs disclosure to author). Inline ⚠️ unverified marker on the One-Click DR GA/surface
    area pending current confluent-docs revalidation (the relevant Cloud Gateway DR pages
    returned 302 redirects in the 2026-05-18 validation pass). confidence: medium.

    article on Confluent Gateway — the self-managed protocol-aware Kafka proxy (CFK/Docker)
    for custom domains, auth swapping, traffic control, fencing/unfencing, and DR client
    switchover without restart. Disambiguates from the Confluent Cloud Ingress
    PrivateLink Gateway (covered in concepts/private-networking.md). MCP direct-URL
    fetches for Confluent Gateway docs returned 302 redirects (product is real but
    canonical doc URL not discoverable from llms.txt index in this session). Authored
    from the queue stub description + cross-references to the resolved ORKA/proxy DR
    validation reports (outputs/reports/wiki-validation-2026-05-15.md and
    wiki-validation-2026-05-18-orka-guarantees.md). Inline ⚠️ unverified markers on:
    (1) the 1.1.0 GA / CPC Gateway 1.2 version-feature pairing, (2) exact CFK CRD
    naming, (3) the 1.5–2× sizing heuristic. confidence: medium pending a

    Schema Registry as source-of-truth, supported encodings (Avro/Protobuf/JSON Schema),
    automatic compaction + snapshot bounds (min 10 / max 100), catalog targets
    (AWS Glue, Databricks Unity, Apache Polaris, Snowflake Open Catalog, built-in IRC),
    storage models (managed vs BYOS, Delta-only BYOS), and the AWS+Azure-only / not-GCP /

    Fulfills the auto-stub queued from /review (2026-05-12). Companion concept article to
    the existing wiki/patterns/connect-deployment-models.md: pattern covers operational
    decision matrix + tuning + triage; this concept article covers framework-level
    architecture (workers, connectors, tasks, converters, SMTs, internal topics,
    standalone vs distributed, KIP-618 EOS source, source vs sink lifecycle, the three
    Confluent deployment models as architecture). MCP validation partial — confluent-docs
    Connect overview pages exceeded fetch token limits; relied on the already-validated
    pattern article + well-established Connect framework knowledge. One inline
    ⚠️ unverified marker on current CC Custom Connector + PrivateLink support
    compatibility (subject to product evolution). confidence: medium pending a
    /wiki:validate pass.

    following topic anchors: PrivateLink Gateway (replacing PLATT, AWS 2026-02-12 /
    Azure+GCP 2026-05-04), Azure/AWS/GCP Private Link setup, Enterprise vs Dedicated
    cluster requirements, Flink-to-Kafka internal routing (gateway covers client→Flink
    only; Flink↔Kafka stays on Confluent fabric), egress PrivateLink for external
    services (AWS/Azure only — no GCP), and the Azure ILB idle-timeout bypass via
    Private Link. No raw/ source file — content compiled directly from confluent-docs
    MCP pages (PLATT pages per cloud, PrivateLink Gateway pages per cloud, Flink
    private-networking ingress and egress pages). All claims validated against those
    MCP sources except the Azure ILB idle-timeout default/max values, which carry an
    inline ⚠️ unverified tag (architectural claim — that Private Link bypasses the
    ILB — is sound; specific timeout numbers should be reconfirmed via current Azure
    docs before customer-facing use). confidence: high.

    Section ordering (Claude's Discretion per CONTEXT.md): (1) Database prerequisites first, (2) Connector
    config recipes second, (3) Troubleshooting last as a triage table — mirrors operational reading order
    (pre-deploy → deploy → debug). Cite all three upstream_paths in frontmatter as a yaml list:
      upstream_path:
        - skills/confluent-cloud-cdc-tableflow/references/connector-configs.md
        - skills/confluent-cloud-cdc-tableflow/references/database-prerequisites.md
        - skills/confluent-cloud-cdc-tableflow/references/troubleshooting.md
    Provenance footer should list all three files. Seeds trip-wire #3 (oracle-xstream-source-limitations).

    Trip-wire #1 (H.1). Authored via full MCP-validation gate (D-07): confluent-docs query on Tableflow
    materialization semantics confirmed the immutability behavior (mode cached on first materialize;
    S3 table_path keyed by Kafka topic name; recreate requires deleting both Tableflow and Kafka topics).

    query on Tableflow APPEND vs CHANGELOG mode tombstone handling confirmed Debezium emits null-value
    records on DELETE and Tableflow APPEND suspends on the first null. Canonical Flink decode pattern
    is the load-bearing remediation. Single-fact-focused, ≤500 words, confidence: high.
