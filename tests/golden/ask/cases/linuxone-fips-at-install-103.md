## Case: FIPS-at-install OCP requirement (WIKI-04, gap G-02)

**What the answer MUST contain:**
- Citation of wiki/concepts/fips-at-install-ocp-requirement.md
- Explanation that `spec.tls.fips.enabled` is silently no-op on non-FIPS OCP install
- Red Hat does not support post-install FIPS conversion — must be set in install-config.yaml at install time

**What the answer MUST NOT contain:**
- Refusal to answer the FIPS question
- Suggestion that post-install FIPS conversion is supported

**Negative-space trigger:** NO
