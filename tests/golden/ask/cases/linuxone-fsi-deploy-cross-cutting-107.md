## Case: Cross-cutting FSI hardening controls in the LinuxONE accelerator (WIKI-05)

**What the answer MUST contain:**
- RBAC (layer 01) — auditor-readonly payload isolation, 6 FSI roles, LDAP-group identity boundary
- mTLS (layer 02) — confluent-ca-issuer, FIPS-at-install OCP requirement
- Schema Registry governance (layer 03) — FULL_TRANSITIVE compatibility
- Audit logging (layer 04) — Connect-based SIEM shipping (Splunk Sink / HTTP Sink → Dynatrace)
- Flink (layer 05) — mTLS to brokers, encrypted checkpoint storage

**What the answer MUST NOT contain:**
- Refusal to answer about FSI hardening
- Suggestion that all layers are optional

**Negative-space trigger:** NO
