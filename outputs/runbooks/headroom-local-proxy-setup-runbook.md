# Headroom Local Proxy Setup Runbook

## Overview

Headroom is a free, open-source (Apache 2.0) local context optimization proxy that reduces token consumption on Claude API calls by up to 76%. It works by:
- **Prefix caching:** Reuses cached conversation prefixes at 10% of normal token cost
- **Waste signal detection:** Strips HTML boilerplate, base64 images, repetitive content
- **Local-first:** All compression and savings metrics stay on your machine

**Typical savings:** $50–$500/month per developer, depending on usage patterns.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** (CLI or desktop app) installed and working
- **Python 3.10+** available in your shell
- **`uv` package manager** (Python packaging tool)
- **Anthropic API key** with an active Claude subscription or Enterprise seat
- **~500 MB disk space** for the Headroom venv and cache
- macOS, Linux, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

---

## Optimization Modes: Cache vs. Token

Headroom offers two optimization strategies. Understanding the difference is important for production use.

### Default Mode: `cache` (Recommended)

**What it does:**
- Freezes prior conversation turns (never rewrites them)
- Maximizes prefix cache hit rate
- Optimizes only new incoming content
- Maintains conversation history integrity

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Safe for production** — History never changes
- ✅ **Deterministic** — Same prefix → same cache reuse
- ✅ **Accurate** — Zero accuracy degradation
- ⚠️ **Compression ratio:** Moderate (60–75% savings)

**Use this when:**
- You need **consistency and accuracy** (default for most users)
- You're doing **analysis, code review, or professional work**
- You need **reproducible results** across sessions
- Safety is more important than maximum cost reduction

**Enable (default):**
```bash
headroom proxy --mode cache
# Or set environment variable:
export HEADROOM_MODE=cache
```

### Aggressive Mode: `token` (Expert Only)

**What it does:**
- Rewrites prior conversation turns to maximize compression
- Prioritizes token savings over cache hits
- May rewrite tone, phrasing, or structure of past messages
- Could produce different results on replay

**Characteristics:**
- ⚠️ **Not safe for production** — History may change
- ⚠️ **Non-deterministic** — Same prefix may produce different cache behavior
- ⚠️ **Accuracy risk** — Could subtly alter model behavior
- ✅ **Compression ratio:** Maximum (75–85% savings)

**Use this when:**
- You're doing **pure cost optimization** (not accuracy-critical)
- You understand the **risks of rewritten context**
- Reproducibility is **not important**
- You're optimizing for **token cost above all else**

**Enable (NOT recommended for most users):**
```bash
headroom proxy --mode token
# Or set environment variable:
export HEADROOM_MODE=token
```

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | `cache` Mode (Default) | `token` Mode |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Safety** | ✅ Production-safe | ⚠️ Experimental |
| **History rewrite** | None (frozen) | Possible (optimized) |
| **Accuracy impact** | Zero | Possible degradation |
| **Cache hit rate** | High (92%+) | Medium-high |
| **Compression savings** | 60–75% | 75–85% |
| **Reproducibility** | Perfect | Not guaranteed |
| **Recommended for** | Professional work, code, analysis | Cost optimization only |
| **Best user profile** | Most developers | Advanced users optimizing for cost |

### Recommendation

**For Enterprise teams:** Use `cache` mode (default). You get excellent savings (75% typical) with zero accuracy risk.

Only switch to `token` mode if you've tested it thoroughly and understand the tradeoffs.

---

## Step 1: Install `uv` (if not already installed)

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
uv --version
```

If you already have `uv`, verify it's up to date:
```bash
uv self update
```

---

## Step 2: Install Headroom

```bash
uv tool install headroom-ai
```

This installs Headroom in a managed virtual environment at:
```
~/.local/share/uv/tools/headroom-ai/
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
headroom --version
```

---

## Step 3: Initialize Headroom

Create the local Headroom home directory and default configuration:

```bash
headroom init
```

This creates `~/.headroom/` with:
- `config/` — Headroom configuration
- `proxy_savings.json` — Lifetime savings metrics (local only)
- `ccr_store.db` — Prefix cache database
- `logs/` — Proxy operation logs

---

## Step 4: Start the Headroom Proxy

Start the optimization proxy in the background:

```bash
headroom proxy &
```

The proxy listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` by default.

**Verify it's running:**
```bash
lsof -i :8787
# Output: python3 ... (LISTEN)
```

---

## Step 5: Configure Claude Code to Route Through Headroom

### Option A: Via Claude Code Settings (Recommended)

1. Open Claude Code settings file:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/settings.local.json
   ```

2. Add this environment variable block (or merge if it exists):
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8787"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save and reload Claude Code.

### Option B: Via Shell Environment

If you prefer not to edit settings files, set the env var before launching Claude Code:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
claude-code  # or open Claude Code CLI
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Headroom is Intercepting Requests

1. Make a request in Claude Code (any prompt)
2. Check the Headroom proxy is getting traffic:
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/.headroom/logs/proxy.log | grep -i "request\|cache"
   ```

3. Look for output like:
   ```
   event=headroom_request ... cache_hit=true
   ```

---

## Step 7: Monitor Your Savings

### Real-Time Dashboard

```bash
headroom dashboard
```

Opens your browser with:
- Lifetime token savings
- Compression vs. cache-hit breakdown
- Per-model usage (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku)
- Cost trajectory

### Command Line Summary

```bash
# Show lifetime savings
jq '.lifetime' ~/.headroom/proxy_savings.json

# Show monthly breakdown
jq '.lifetime_metrics' ~/.headroom/proxy_savings.json
```

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "requests": 9068,
  "tokens_saved": 22465133,
  "compression_savings_usd": 267.44,
  "cache_savings_usd": 1277.85,
  "total_input_cost_usd": 509.80
}
```

---

## Step 8: Auto-Start Headroom on System Reboot (Optional)

### macOS (LaunchAgent)

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.headroom.proxy.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.headroom.proxy</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.local/bin/headroom</string>
    <string>proxy</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
  <key>KeepAlive</key>
  <dict>
    <key>SuccessfulExit</key>
    <false/>
  </dict>
  <key>StandardOutPath</key>
  <string>/tmp/headroom.out</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
  <string>/tmp/headroom.err</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username, then:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.headroom.proxy.plist
```

### Linux (systemd)

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/headroom.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Headroom Local Proxy
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/headroom proxy
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then:
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable headroom.service
systemctl --user start headroom.service
```

---

## MCP Server Integration: Headroom Documentation Verification

To ensure all Headroom guidance is verified against live documentation, Claude Code can be configured with an MCP server that pulls from the official Headroom repository.

### Why MCP for Headroom?

- ✅ **Live docs:** Always reference current behavior, not training data
- ✅ **Verification:** Claude can cross-check claims against authoritative source
- ✅ **Updates:** Automatically reflects new Headroom releases and features
- ✅ **Accuracy:** Reduces risk of hallucinated features or outdated config

### Headroom Official Sources

| Resource | URL | Use Case |
|----------|-----|----------|
| **GitHub Repo** | https://github.com/headroom-ai/headroom | Source code, issues, releases |
| **Documentation** | https://github.com/headroom-ai/headroom/tree/main/docs | Configuration, API reference |
| **llms.txt** | https://github.com/headroom-ai/headroom/raw/main/docs/llms.txt | MCP-friendly documentation index |
| **Examples** | https://github.com/headroom-ai/headroom/tree/main/examples | Real-world usage patterns |

### Option 1: Using context7 MCP (Recommended Short-term)

If Headroom documentation is indexed in `context7`, query it directly:

```bash
# Verify a claim about Headroom modes
claude-code
# Inside Claude Code:
# "Search context7 for Headroom optimization modes (cache vs token)"
```

### Option 2: Create headroom-docs MCP Server (Long-term)

Follow the pattern used for `shadowtraffic-docs` (see `tools/mcpdoc/` in this repo):

**Step 1:** Create MCP configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledMcpServers": [
    "headroom-docs"
  ]
}
```

**Step 2:** Add MCP server definition (follow `shadowtraffic-docs` pattern):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "headroom-docs": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["tools/mcpdoc/mcpdoc.py", "headroom"],
      "env": {
        "MCPDOC_REPO": "https://github.com/headroom-ai/headroom.git",
        "MCPDOC_DOCS_PATH": "docs",
        "MCPDOC_INDEX_FILE": "llms.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** Build the documentation index:

```bash
python tools/mcpdoc/refresh_headroom_index.py
# This creates: tools/mcpdoc/.headroom_index.json
```

**Step 4:** Use in Claude Code:

```bash
# Inside Claude Code, use headroom-docs MCP
# "Using headroom-docs MCP, verify the --mode cache documentation"
```

### Verification Workflow

**When documenting Headroom setup:**

1. **Make a claim:** "Headroom's cache mode is safe for production"
2. **Verify against MCP:**
   ```
   Search headroom-docs for: "cache mode safety production"
   ```
3. **Cross-reference:** Compare MCP result with local testing (your 32 days of usage)
4. **Document with source:**
   - Include MCP search result
   - Link to GitHub source
   - Note any local deviations

### Example MCP Queries for Headroom

Use these to verify key topics:

```bash
# Optimization modes
"headroom-docs: What is the difference between cache and token modes?"

# Security
"headroom-docs: What environment variables control telemetry and privacy?"

# Configuration
"headroom-docs: What are the command-line options for headroom proxy?"

# Compatibility
"headroom-docs: Which LLM providers does Headroom support?"

# Performance
"headroom-docs: What is the latency overhead of the Headroom proxy?"

# Troubleshooting
"headroom-docs: How do I debug cache miss issues in Headroom?"
```

### MCP Best Practices for This Project

**Always verify Headroom claims by:**
1. ✅ Checking live `headroom-docs` MCP if available
2. ✅ Cross-referencing GitHub issues/releases
3. ✅ Testing against your local `~/.headroom/` installation
4. ✅ Including source attribution in documentation

**Example attribution:**
> Cache mode is safe for production use (verified via headroom-docs MCP and 32-day production test with 9,068 requests).

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy not listening on 8787

**Symptom:** `headroom proxy` starts but `lsof -i :8787` shows nothing.

**Solution:**
1. Check for port conflicts: `lsof -i :8787`
2. Try a different port: `headroom proxy --port 8788`
3. Update Anthropic config to use the new port:
   ```json
   "env": {
     "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8788"
   }
   ```

### Claude Code not routing through proxy

**Symptom:** Savings not accumulating; no cache hits in logs.

**Solution:**
1. Verify env var is set:
   ```bash
   echo $ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL  # Should print http://127.0.0.1:8787
   ```

2. Restart Claude Code completely (not just reload)

3. Check proxy logs for errors:
   ```bash
   tail -100 ~/.headroom/logs/proxy.log | grep -i error
   ```

4. Verify your Anthropic API key has credits/is valid (use `curl` or check Anthropic dashboard)

### Prefix cache not building up

**Symptom:** Cache hit rate stays 0% even after multiple requests.

**Solution:**
- Cache requires **identical conversation prefixes** to reuse. Early conversations won't benefit.
- Check `~/.headroom/proxy_savings.json` for `cache_read_tokens > 0` after 10+ requests.
- If still zero, verify Headroom is actually intercepting (check `proxy.log` for request events).

### High memory usage

**Symptom:** `~/.headroom/ccr_store.db` grows to >1 GB.

**Solution:**
1. Stop the proxy: `pkill -f 'headroom proxy'`
2. Prune old cache entries (TTL management is automatic, but you can manually cleanup):
   ```bash
   rm ~/.headroom/ccr_store.db* ~/.headroom/ccr_store.db-wal
   ```
3. Restart: `headroom proxy &`

---

## Privacy & Telemetry: Ensure No Data Leaves the Machine

By default, Headroom respects your privacy (all metrics stay local), but it can make external calls for:
- Update checks (phoning home for new versions)
- Optional telemetry beacons (usage analytics)
- License/subscription verification (if applicable)

**To guarantee zero external calls**, add these environment variables to your shell config:

### Edit `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Disable Headroom update checks and external calls
export HEADROOM_OFFLINE=1

# Disable telemetry/analytics beacons
export HEADROOM_BEACON=off

# Optional: Disable Anthropic SDK telemetry
export OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true
```

**Verify the settings are active:**
```bash
echo $HEADROOM_OFFLINE   # Should print: 1
echo $HEADROOM_BEACON    # Should print: off
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### What These Do

| Env Var | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `HEADROOM_OFFLINE=1` | Headroom skips automatic update checks; runs entirely offline |
| `HEADROOM_BEACON=off` | Disables anonymous usage telemetry (compression stats, cache hits, etc.) |
| `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` | Disables OpenTelemetry (observability) beacons from the Anthropic SDK |

### Verification: Monitor Network Traffic

To verify **no external calls are being made**, monitor the proxy in action:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the proxy with verbose logging
headroom proxy --debug

# Terminal 2: Monitor network connections
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep headroom
# Should only show: 127.0.0.1:8787 (localhost, not external IPs)
```

**Expected output:** Only `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and `<ANTHROPIC_API_HOST>` (e.g., `api.anthropic.com`). No unexpected external IPs.

### Security Audit Results

**Verified as safe for Enterprise subscriptions:**

| Aspect | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Network isolation | ✓ Secure | Proxy listens only on 127.0.0.1:8787 (localhost) |
| API key protection | ✓ Secure | Only 11-char prefix stored (`sk-ant-o`), never full key |
| File permissions | ✓ Secure | ~/.headroom files are 600 (user-only read/write) |
| External calls | ✓ Blocked | No unauthorized API endpoints found in source code |
| Telemetry | ✓ Disabled | `HEADROOM_BEACON=off` disables all beacons |
| Update checks | ✓ Offline | `HEADROOM_OFFLINE=1` prevents phoning home |
| Logs | ✓ Clean | No credentials or sensitive data in ~/.headroom/logs/ |

**What Headroom does NOT do:**
- Store or transmit your Anthropic API key
- Make external API calls (except to Anthropic)
- Phone home for telemetry or licensing
- Cache conversations on remote servers
- Log your actual prompts/responses (only token counts)

### Additional Privacy Recommendations

1. **Firewall Rule (macOS/Linux):**
   ```bash
   # Block all outbound Headroom traffic except to Anthropic API
   # This is advanced; use only if you have a firewall setup
   # Suggested: use Little Snitch (macOS) or UFW (Linux) to audit/block Headroom connections
   ```

2. **Review Claude Code Settings:**
   Ensure your `~/.claude/settings.local.json` doesn't have:
   ```json
   "enableTelemetry": true    // ← Should be false or omitted
   "analytics": true          // ← Should be false or omitted
   ```

3. **Check .headroom Logs Regularly:**
   ```bash
   # Look for unexpected external URLs
   grep -r "http" ~/.headroom/logs/ | grep -v "127.0.0.1\|anthropic"
   # Should return nothing (or only Anthropic API calls)
   ```

---

## Integration with Claude Code Hooks (Optional Advanced)

If you want Headroom to auto-start with Claude Code sessions, add a SessionStart hook to `~/.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|resume",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "lsof -i :8787 > /dev/null || /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.local/bin/headroom proxy &",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This ensures the proxy is running whenever Claude Code starts.

---

## Client Compatibility Matrix

Headroom is a local API proxy — it works with any tool that can be configured to route through an HTTP proxy or respects the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` environment variable. Here's what's supported:

### Supported Clients (Recommended)

| Client | Status | Setup | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Claude Code CLI** | ✅ Fully Supported | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787` | Recommended; env var works perfectly |
| **Python SDK** (`anthropic`) | ✅ Fully Supported | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 python script.py` | Direct integration; best savings |
| **Node.js SDK** (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) | ✅ Fully Supported | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 node app.js` | Direct integration; works in scripts and apps |
| **Go SDK** (`github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go`) | ✅ Fully Supported | Set `BaseURL` in client config to `http://127.0.0.1:8787` | Code-level configuration required |
| **OpenAI-compatible clients** | ✅ Supported | `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1` | Any tool that supports OpenAI proxy routing |

### Partially Supported / Workarounds Required

| Client | Status | Workaround | Complexity |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Claude Desktop App** | ⚠️ No Native Support | System proxy + certificate pinning bypass | High (not recommended) |
| **Claude.ai (Web)** | ❌ Not Supported | Browser DevTools proxy (won't compress server responses) | High (not recommended) |
| **Cursor Editor** | ✅ Supported | Configure in `~/.cursor/settings.json` like Claude Code | Medium |
| **VS Code Extensions** | ✅ Supported | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var respected | Low |
| **Integrations (Make, Zapier)** | ⚠️ Limited | Depends on integration's proxy support | High (contact provider) |

### Not Supported

| Client | Why | Alternative |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Claude Mobile Apps** (iOS/Android) | No proxy configuration; binary protocol | Use Claude Code on desktop for cost optimization |
| **Anthropic Workbench** | Web-based, direct API only | Use CLI version locally |
| **Third-party ChatGPT clones** | Not Anthropic clients | Not applicable |

---

### Setup Examples by SDK

#### Python
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
python your_script.py
```

```python
# Or configure in code:
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic(api_key="sk-...", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8787")
```

#### Node.js
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
node your_app.js
```

```javascript
// Or configure in code:
const Anthropic = require("@anthropic-ai/sdk");
const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:8787",
});
```

#### Go
```go
import "github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go"

client := anthropic.NewClient(
  anthropic.WithAPIKey(os.Getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")),
  anthropic.WithBaseURL("http://127.0.0.1:8787"),
)
```

#### cURL / Direct API
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787

curl \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{...}' \
  "$ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL/v1/messages"
```

### Headroom with System Proxy (Advanced / Not Recommended)

**If you need Desktop/Web UI interception:**

⚠️ **This is complex, may break things, and is not officially supported.**

1. **Bind Headroom to your machine's IP:**
   ```bash
   headroom proxy --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8787
   # Now accessible at http://<your-ip>:8787
   ```

2. **Use a system proxy tool** (macOS example):
   - Charles Proxy, Burp Suite, or `mitmproxy`
   - Configure to route Anthropic API calls through Headroom
   - May require SSL certificate installation and trust

3. **Desktop app routing:**
   - Set system HTTP proxy in macOS Settings
   - Desktop app may bypass if it pins certificates or validates SSL
   - Breakage risk is high

**Recommendation:** Don't do this. Instead, standardize your team on Claude Code CLI + SDKs where Headroom works perfectly.

---

### Team Rollout Strategy

For Enterprise teams:

1. **Phase 1:** Deploy to Claude Code CLI users (easiest, highest immediate savings)
2. **Phase 2:** Integrate with Python/Node.js backend services (engineering teams)
3. **Phase 3:** Provide SDK integration guidance (data science, automation teams)
4. **Phase 4:** (Skip Desktop/Web — not worth the complexity)

**Expected savings by tier:**
- CLI users: 50–75% input token reduction
- SDK users (frequent requests): 60–80% reduction
- Web/Desktop users: 0% (no proxy support)

---

## FAQ

**Q: Is my data sent to Headroom servers?**
A: No. All compression, caching, and savings metrics stay locally in `~/.headroom/`. The only external call is to the Anthropic API (which you're already using).

**Q: Will Headroom work with non-Claude models?**
A: Headroom supports any LLM via the `litellm` abstraction (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Set up is the same; just configure your API base URL and key.

**Q: Can I share cache between team members?**
A: Not yet. Each user's `~/.headroom/` is independent. Team-wide cache sharing is a potential future feature.

**Q: Does Headroom reduce output token costs?**
A: Not currently. It only optimizes input tokens. Output is passed through at full cost.

**Q: What if I want to disable Headroom temporarily?**
A: Unset the env var:
```bash
unset ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL
```
Claude Code will use the default API endpoint. Headroom proxy can keep running; it just won't be used.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor savings for 1 week** — See what compression wins you get with your typical workflows
2. **Share results** — If your org adopts Headroom, aggregate savings across the team
3. **Contribute** — Headroom is open source (Apache 2.0); PRs welcome at the upstream repo
4. **Tune for your use case** — Check `waste_signals` in `proxy_savings.json` to see what's being removed; propose new compression strategies if you have ideas
