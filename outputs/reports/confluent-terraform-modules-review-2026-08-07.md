# Review: confluent-terraform-modules — Gateway & YAML Schema Breakdown

**Date:** 2026-08-07
**Source files:** ~/GoodLabs/confluent-terraform-modules/README.md, ~/GoodLabs/confluent-terraform-modules/CLAUDE.md
**Scope:** YAML-driven Terraform module set for Confluent Cloud — specifically the Network/Gateway config surface (`pni`, `privatelink`, `privatelink_gateway`), cluster-type gating, and provider-version claims, cross-checked against Confluent's own documentation, and evaluated for client-facing clarity.
**Claims extracted:** 12

## Summary

The `privatelink`/`privatelink_gateway` split itself is accurate and well-evidenced against Confluent's Terraform provider schema and docs — that part of this session's work holds up. But the review surfaced a real, structural problem one layer up: **this repo's documentation has told clients for a while that PNI works on Dedicated clusters, and it doesn't** — Confluent's own AWS Private Network Feature Support matrix (and this project's own wiki) show PNI is Enterprise/Freight-only. That claim appears in three places (README's Network section, its Cluster type guide table, and its "verified working end-to-end" callout), and unlike the two PrivateLink paths, **PNI has no plan-time guard catching a Dedicated cluster that tries to use it** — meaning a client following this repo's own docs today can walk straight into an unguarded, unsupported combination. A second, smaller issue: the provider-version bump made earlier this session (`~> 2.47.0` → `~> 2.60.0`) landed correctly in every `.tf` file but was missed in one prose sentence in the README, so the two files now disagree with each other. Recommendations below address both, plus the client-usability gap the prompt asked about directly: nothing in this repo currently helps a client choose between the three networking options based on the trade-offs (eCKU ceiling, BYOK/Access Transparency availability) that actually differ between them.

## Claim Validation

### Repository structure & versioning

| # | Claim | Wiki | MCP | Skill | Skill Verdict | Verdict |
|---|-------|------|-----|-------|---------------|---------|
| readme-1 | `networking/` listed as "placeholder — coming soon" | — | — (internal consistency check, not a doc lookup) | — | — | **Corrected** |
| readme-2 | Provider pin `~> 2.47.0` | — | `terraform-provider-confluent` CHANGELOG.md (fetched this session) | — | — | **Corrected** |
| readme-6 | Tree diagrams list only `pni or privatelink` | — | — (internal consistency check) | — | — | **Corrected** |
| claude-1 | "PNI/PrivateLink (enterprise/dedicated)" grouping | `wiki/concepts/network-connectivity-by-tier.md` | `docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/overview.md` | — | — | **Corrected** (imprecise phrasing, contributes to readme-3/4/5's error) |

**Corrections:**
- **#readme-1:** `modules/networking/` contains three fully implemented, validated modules (`pni`, `privatelink`, `privatelink_gateway`) — none of this is a placeholder. This line predates the PrivateLink work and was never updated; it actively misleads a new reader skimming the repo layout before reading further. Fix: replace with the real subtree (`networking/aws/{pni,privatelink,privatelink_gateway}`).
- **#readme-2:** The provider pin was bumped to `~> 2.60.0` across every `versions.tf` and both example `providers.tf` this session (confirmed via `grep -rn "~> 2.6" --include="*.tf"` — 10/10 files consistent). This one sentence in the Development section is the sole holdout still saying `~> 2.47.0`, directly contradicting `terraform init`'s actual behavior and CLAUDE.md's own account of the bump.
- **#readme-6:** The Concept and Config-file-reference tree diagrams (two separate spots) say "one file = one private network (pni or privatelink)" — both predate `privatelink_gateway` and now disagree with the fully-updated Network section eight lines below them. Minor on its own, but it's exactly the kind of first-impression inconsistency a client hits before reaching the section that actually explains the distinction.
- **#claude-1:** Not a factual error on its own — the sentence is about environment segregation, not a networking-support claim — but pairing "PNI/PrivateLink" and "(enterprise/dedicated)" as if either backs either reinforces the same wrong mental model corrected below (readme-3/4/5). Worth rewording once those are fixed, so this note doesn't silently keep the misconception alive after the primary claims are corrected.

### Network / Gateway cluster-tier gating

| # | Claim | Wiki | MCP | Skill | Skill Verdict | Verdict |
|---|-------|------|-----|-------|---------------|---------|
| readme-3 | "`type: pni` works on both `dedicated` and `enterprise`" | `wiki/concepts/network-connectivity-by-tier.md` | `docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/overview.md` (AWS Private Network Feature Support table, fetched this session) | — | — | **Corrected** |
| readme-4 | Dedicated: "Yes (VPC peering or PNI)" | same as above | same as above | — | — | **Corrected** |
| readme-5 | "PNI integration... verified working end-to-end for both cluster types" | same as above | same as above | — | — | **Corrected** |
| readme-8 | Requires provider `>= 2.60.0` for `aws_ingress_private_link_gateway` | — | `terraform-provider-confluent` CHANGELOG.md + `terraform providers schema -json` (both fetched/run this session) | — | — | **Confirmed** |
| readme-9 | `privatelink_gateway` has no account-whitelist step | — | `registry.terraform.io/.../confluent_gateway` + `confluent_access_point` resource schemas (fetched this session) | — | — | **Confirmed** |
| readme-10 | DNS automation split (privatelink/privatelink_gateway auto; pni opt-in) | — | `docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/aws-platt.md` + `aws-privatelink.md` (fetched this session) | — | — | **Confirmed** |
| readme-11 | Freight: RBAC Yes | — | `docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/cluster-types.md` (fetched this session) | — | — | **Confirmed** |

**Corrections:**
- **#readme-3 / #readme-4 / #readme-5 — the same underlying error, stated three times.** Confluent's own AWS Private Network Feature Support matrix lists Private Network Interface support for **Enterprise** and **Freight** clusters only — the Dedicated row has no checkmark in that column at all (Dedicated instead gets VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, and PrivateLink-Dedicated). This project's own `wiki/concepts/network-connectivity-by-tier.md` independently confirms the same thing: its connectivity table lists PNI under "Enterprise, Freight (AWS only)" and explicitly excludes Dedicated. So this isn't a close call needing interpretation — two independent sources (fetched fresh this session and pre-existing in this knowledge base) agree, and the repo's docs disagree with both.
  - Practical consequence: `modules/networking/aws/pni` has **no cluster-tier guard at all** (unlike the two PrivateLink modules, which this session added `_validate_privatelink_cluster_type`/`_validate_privatelink_gateway_cluster_type` preconditions for specifically because the wrong-tier case used to fail opaquely at Confluent's API). A client who reads "PNI works on both dedicated and enterprise," sets `cluster_type: dedicated` + `network: { type: pni }`, and runs `terraform apply` gets no `plan`-time warning — they hit whatever error Confluent's API actually returns for that combination, live, the same class of problem this session just fixed for PrivateLink.
  - Also worth checking directly: every real example in this repo (`environment1/clusters/enterprise.yaml`) uses PNI with `cluster_type: enterprise`, never `dedicated` — nothing in the repo's own test coverage actually exercises the "verified... for both cluster types" claim for Dedicated. The claim reads as an assumption stated as a verified fact.
  - Fix: correct all three locations to say PNI is Enterprise/Freight-only; Dedicated's private-networking options are VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, or `privatelink` (Dedicated PrivateLink) — never PNI. Then decide whether to add the same kind of `plan`-time guard PrivateLink just got, so this doesn't repeat the exact failure mode this session already fixed once.
- **#readme-8 / #readme-9 / #readme-10 / #readme-11 confirmed as stated** — no changes needed on these.

### Gaps checked, unresolved

| # | Claim | Wiki | MCP | Verdict |
|---|-------|------|-----|---------|
| readme-7 | "Schema contexts... not supported in Confluent Cloud Schema Registry" | no matching article | `docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/stream-governance/schema-contexts.md` returned a redirect/404 this session — could not locate the current doc at that path | **Unverifiable** |

## Premise Challenge

| # | Premise | Assumption | Challenge | Severity |
|---|---------|------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | A client reading the README's prose alone can correctly pick between `pni` / `privatelink` / `privatelink_gateway` for their cluster tier. | The three options are documented clearly enough, in one place, to self-serve the right choice. | There's no decision table or flowchart — just three parallel schema blocks. Worse, per readme-3/4/5, the guidance that *does* exist for one of the three (PNI) is itself wrong. A client following this doc as written today could configure an unsupported combination the repo won't catch. | **Critical** |
| 2 | The provider-version constraint is uniform and matches what `terraform init` will actually resolve. | Every place the version is mentioned agrees. | It doesn't — `versions.tf` (10/10 files) says `~> 2.60.0`; README's Development section still says `~> 2.47.0`. A client copying that line into their own tooling or CI pin would diverge from what this repo's own modules actually require. | Moderate |
| 3 | The three private-networking options are freely interchangeable alternatives, chosen by preference. | Cost/throughput/feature trade-offs between them either don't exist or don't matter for this repo's audience. | They're not interchangeable at all, on axes this repo never surfaces: per `cluster-types.md`, Enterprise clusters on **PrivateLink** are capped at 10 eCKU, while Enterprise on **PNI** unlocks 32 eCKU — a client optimizing purely for "which is simpler to set up" could end up on the option with a 3x lower throughput ceiling without ever being told the ceiling differs. | **Critical** (directly undercuts the "easier for clients to use" ask) |
| 4 | PNI is the lower-risk option of the three, so it doesn't need the same plan-time guard the two PrivateLink modules just got. | Guard coverage roughly tracks actual risk. | The opposite looks true right now: PNI is the one path with **both** an active documentation error (readme-3/4/5) **and** no guard — the exact failure mode (wrong tier, opaque API rejection) that motivated adding guards to `privatelink`/`privatelink_gateway` this session is currently *more* exposed on PNI, not less. | **Critical** |
| 5 | The choice between PNI and PrivateLink has no bearing on this project's FSI posture. | Regulated-environment requirements are indifferent to which private-networking model is used. | Per `cluster-types.md`'s feature comparison table, **self-managed encryption keys (BYOK)** and **Access Transparency** are Dedicated/Enterprise-tier features gated independently of the networking choice, but PrivateLink-Dedicated and PNI-Enterprise land on different cluster tiers with different feature ceilings — an FSI client choosing based on this repo's docs alone has no way to know that. Canon calls for exactly this kind of security-posture trade-off to be surfaced explicitly. | Moderate |

## Canon Compliance

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Security posture (mTLS + RBAC in regulated environments) | Partial | RBAC-vs-ACL gating by cluster tier is correctly documented and enforced (`CLAUDE.md`'s "Enterprise/dedicated vs standard/basic" section); mTLS/client-auth configuration for the Kafka cluster itself isn't addressed anywhere in this repo — out of scope for a cluster/topic/IAM provisioning tool, but worth a one-line pointer for FSI users. |
| Schema Registry governance | Compliant | The Topic YAML example uses AVRO with `FULL_TRANSITIVE` compatibility — matches canon's "Avro/Protobuf in production" default directly. |
| Naming convention (`<domain>.<entity>.<event>`) | Partial | Example topics (`payments.created`, `datagen.users`) follow a `domain.event`-shaped pattern but skip the `entity` segment canon specifies — minor, and it's example data rather than an enforced convention in the module itself. |
| Service accounts per application, not per team | Compliant | `modules/iam`'s one-SA-per-named-principal pattern (`admin`, `consumer-payments`, `datagen`) matches canon directly, and CLAUDE.md's "Design philosophy to preserve" section explicitly rules out implicit/shared-grant shortcuts. |
| Audit logging on production clusters | Gap | `cluster-types.md` confirms Audit Logs as a feature on Standard/Enterprise/Dedicated/Freight (not Basic) — this repo doesn't reference enabling or verifying it anywhere. |
| Private connectivity for prod (FSI default) | Partial (see Premise Challenge #5) | PNI/PrivateLink both satisfy "no public endpoint," but the repo doesn't surface the BYOK/Access Transparency feature-ceiling difference between the tiers each model is gated to. |

## Gaps

- **readme-7** (schema contexts / Confluent Cloud Schema Registry support) — could not verify via MCP this session; the referenced doc path redirected. Queued below rather than asserted either way.
- Whether `modules/networking/aws/pni` *should* get the same `_validate_*_cluster_type` precondition treatment as the two PrivateLink modules is a design decision, not something MCP/wiki can settle — flagged as a Recommendation instead.

**Auto-stub queued** (`wiki/_queue.md`, no existing coverage found):
```
- [ ] <!-- auto-stub: confluent-cloud-schema-registry-contexts --> wiki/concepts/confluent-cloud-schema-registry-contexts.md — Auto-queued from /review
      Claim: "Schema contexts are a Confluent Platform feature and are not supported in Confluent Cloud Schema Registry" | Date: 2026-08-07 | Source: confluent-terraform-modules/README.md
```

## Recommendations

1. **Fix readme-3/4/5 first — this is the one factual error, and it's the highest-severity finding.** Correct the Network section, the Cluster type guide table, and the "verified... for both cluster types" callout to state PNI is Enterprise/Freight-only. Then decide: add a `_validate_pni_cluster_type`-style precondition to `modules/clusters` (matching the pattern already used for both PrivateLink types), so a client who still gets this wrong from some other source (a colleague, an old doc version, a memory) fails at `plan` with a clear message instead of an opaque Confluent API error.
2. **Reconcile the provider-version mention** (README's Development section → `~> 2.60.0`) so it matches every `.tf` file and CLAUDE.md's own account of the bump.
3. **Update the two stale tree diagrams and the "placeholder" line** so a client's first read of the repo layout matches what's actually there.
4. **Add a short decision table for picking a networking model**, addressing the client-usability ask directly — something in the shape of:

   | Cluster tier | Options | Pick PNI if... | Pick PrivateLink if... |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Enterprise | `pni` or `privatelink_gateway` | You need >10 eCKU (up to 32) or highest throughput at lowest cost | You want the simplest AWS-side setup and ≤10 eCKU is enough |
   | Dedicated | `privatelink` only | — (PNI isn't available on Dedicated) | Always, for private connectivity on Dedicated |

   This turns three parallel schema blocks into an actual decision aid — the specific gap Premise Challenge #1 and #3 identify.
5. **Surface the BYOK/Access Transparency trade-off** (Premise Challenge #5) somewhere near the cluster-type guide, even as a one-line pointer to `cluster-types.md`'s feature comparison table — relevant enough for this project's FSI-oriented audience to be worth the single sentence.
